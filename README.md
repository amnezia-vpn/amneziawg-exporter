# AmneziaWG exporter

amneziawg-exporter is a Prometheus exporter for gathering AmneziaWG client connection metrics.

## Features and limitations

### Client Identification

amneziawg-exporter can optionally identify WireGuard clients using a client table. If this feature is enabled, clients are identified by their names; otherwise, they are marked as "unidentified."

### http/oneshot/metricsfile Modes

amneziawg-exporter has three operating modes (`AWG_EXPORTER_OPS_MODE` environment variable):

- `http` - run an HTTP server on `AWG_EXPORTER_HTTP_PORT` to make metrics accessible, like most exporters. *Default*
- `metricsfile` - write metrics to `AWG_EXPORTER_METRICS_FILE` instead of serving them on http port.
- `oneshot` - same as in `metricsfile`mode but the service creates a metrics file and then shuts down.
  In Docker, you can use a volume to save the file on disk. It can then be taken by [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) to serve your exporter metrics.

## Configuration

The following environment variables can be used to configure amneziawg-exporter.

| Variable Name                        | Default Value               | Description                                                             |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWG_EXPORTER_SCRAPE_INTERVAL         | 60                          | Interval for scraping WireGuard metrics (for 'http' mode).              |
| AWG_EXPORTER_HTTP_PORT               | 9351                        | Port for HTTP service.                                                  |
| AWG_EXPORTER_METRICS_FILE            | /tmp/prometheus/awg.prom    | Path to the metrics file for Node exporter textfile collector.          |
| AWG_EXPORTER_OPS_MODE                | http                        | Operation mode for the exporter ('http', `metricsfile` or 'oneshot').   |
| AWG_EXPORTER_CLIENTS_TABLE_ENABLED   | false                       | Whether to enable client identification using a client table.           |
| AWG_EXPORTER_CLIENTS_TABLE_FILE      | ./clientsTable1             | Path to the client table file.                                          |
| AWG_EXPORTER_AWG_SHOW_EXEC           | "awg show"                  | Command to run the `awg show` command.                                  |

## Metrics

| Metric name                          | Labels               | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| awg_sent_bytes                       | peer, client_name    | Client sent bytes                                                           |
| awg_received_bytes                   | peer, client_name    | Client received bytes                                                       |
| awg_latest_handshake_seconds         | peer, client_name    | Latest client handshake with the server in seconds                          |
| awg_status                           |                      | Exporter status. 1 - OK, 0 - not OK                                         |

> Every metric receives a label `peer` to identify the AmneziaWG peer, and `client_name` to identify the client if client table is enabled.

## Example Usage

You can use example [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) to run the amneziawg-exporter:

```sh
# docker compose up -d
[+] Running 1/1
 âœ” Container amneziawg-exporter  Started                                                                                                                  0.2s 
# docker compose ps
